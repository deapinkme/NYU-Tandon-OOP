// Task 1.2 part 4
Which convert_it() function is invoked? Explain why? 
  Here the convert_it() function from kilos_miles is invoked. This is because we made 
  convert_it() virtual in the base_conversion class and made it an override function
  in kilos_miles.

// Task 1.2 part 9
Which convert_it() function is invoked? Explain why? 
  here the convert_it() function doesn't even exist in yard_meter, so it definitily isn't
  being overriden from the base_conversion. Therefore the convert_it() function from 
  base_conversion is being envokes.

// Task 1.2 part 10
Was it mendatory for derived class yards_meter to override inherited virtual function
of base_conversion class? Explain?

// Task 1.3 part 3
Was this instruction successful? What is the cause of the error if any?
  This was not successful. It caused:
  
  "error: allocating an object of abstract class type 'base_conversion'
  base_conversion* baseOBJ = new base_conversion(100.0);
  note: unimplemented pure virtual method 'convert_it' in
    'base_conversion'
  virtual void convert_it() = 0;"

// Task 1.3 part 5
Was this instruction successful? What is the cause of the error if any?
  This was not successful aswell. It caused:
  
  "error: allocating an object of abstract class type 'yard_meter'
  yard_meter* ymOBJ = new yard_meter(50);
  note: unimplemented pure virtual method 'convert_it' in
    'yard_meter'
  virtual void convert_it() = 0;"
